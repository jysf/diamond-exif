# SPEC-008: Mutation helpers and mutated-copy red-proof apparatus

> **OUTLINE — `cycle: frame`.** This spec exists so its ID is stable. Capture
> **scope** only; the approach is designed just-in-time when it moves to `design`.

## Context

Split out of the original SPEC-005 at its design. SPEC-005 shows the *comparator* can fail (replay-and-perturb). This spec shows the *library* faults get caught by the oracle: inject a fault into a **copy** of the library source, build and run it, and watch the ExifTool comparison go red, after a control run proves the unmutated copy is green (irradiance DEC-009 / `scripts/lint-red-proof.sh`). Brief §2.3: irradiance copy-pasted this apparatus three times (`stage_probe_crate`, `build_and_run_probe`); lift it into `tests/support/` once. Design §8 red-proofs also need byte-mutation helpers that do not exist anywhere yet.

## Goal

`tests/support/mutate.rs` (`set_u32_at`, `flip_bit`, `truncate_at`, `swap_byte_order_mark`, all total and panic-free) and one shared `tests/support/probe.rs` (temp dir, stage a probe crate over a mutated copy of `src/`, build, run, capture output), with at least three red-proofs: corrupt an IFD offset (typed outcome changes, oracle names the field), swap the byte-order mark (values go wrong, oracle red), and an injected library fault in a copy (e.g. a wrong-endian read) caught by live ExifTool parity, each with its control run first.

## Non-Goals

- The comparator, `parse_fields`, fixtures and recording (SPEC-005); JPEG-level red-proofs (truncate between APP1 and SOS, pixel flip) which wait for the container stages
- CI wiring, `lint-red-proof` script work (repo setup)

## Reflection

*Appended during **ship**. Three questions, short answers.*

1. **What would I do differently next time?**
   — <answer>

2. **Does any template, constraint, or decision need updating?**
   — <answer — if yes but not done this session, record it in
   `/guidance/signals.yaml`: `type: lesson` (with its N-count) for a recurring
   coding pattern, `type: process-debt` for tooling/process friction. A close
   then forces the decision. See `docs/signals.md`.>

3. **Is there a follow-up spec I should write now before I forget?**
   — <answer>

4. **Where was the worst defect caught?** — one word from a fixed vocabulary so
   the defect-escape distribution is greppable across specs:
   `design` | `build` | `verify` | `ship` | `escaped` (reached prod/runtime) |
   `none` (clean first try).
   — <one word>
   *(Runtime/operational defects — the escape-prone class — only exist once the
   artifact meets its real host. `escaped` here is a signal to strengthen the
   §12 behavioral pre-flight for that surface.)*

5. **What can a user do now that they couldn't before?** — one sentence,
   before → after; quote the confirming number if one exists, name the outcome
   if not. Write `none` if this spec has no user-visible outcome — that is a
   real, greppable result, not a blank. This is the line a downstream work-log's
   `impact` field is transcribed from, and both halves are already written above
   (## Context is the before, ## Goal is the after): confirm the prediction,
   don't reconstruct it from memory.
   — <answer | none>
