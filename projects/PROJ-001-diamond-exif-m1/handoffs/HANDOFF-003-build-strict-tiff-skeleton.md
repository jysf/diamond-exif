# HANDOFF-003: Port the strict TIFF skeleton

## Delegation Summary

`claude-opus-5-5` (architect) hands `SPEC-002` to `claude-sonnet-5-5` (implementer) for the **build** cycle: port irradiance's DNG-stripped, strict TIFF/IFD walker and its hostile-input tests into `exif-core`, with provenance-ledger rows. Policy stays strict (SPEC-003 changes it).

## Context the Receiving Agent Needs

The receiving agent MUST read these before starting work. Keep the
list tight, but don't omit anything necessary.

### Primary

- **Project brief:** `./projects/PROJ-001-diamond-exif-m1/brief.md`
- **Stage:** `./projects/PROJ-001-diamond-exif-m1/stages/STAGE-001-m1a-foundation-tiff-ifd-engine.md`
- **Spec:** `./projects/PROJ-001-diamond-exif-m1/specs/SPEC-002-strict-tiff-skeleton.md`
- **Reviewer brief (OPTIONAL, verify handoffs):** `./guidance/agents/<lens>.md` —
  pick a lens if this review should look at one thing hard. Omit for a
  general review; see `./guidance/agents/README.md`.
- **Toolchain brief:** `./guidance/toolchain-brief.md` — this repo's test
  framework, lint quirks, runtime globals and gotchas. Read it; it exists so a
  cold agent doesn't rediscover them (DEC-004 rule 5).

### Decisions that apply

- `DEC-001` — context only: do NOT implement the tolerant walk here; keep the strict fatal-on-any-bad-IFD behaviour.
- `DEC-002` — `&[u8]` core; `payload` returns `&'a [u8]` tied to the input; no new dependencies.
- `DEC-003` — every ported file gets a `docs/provenance-ledger.md` row (class 3 derived from class 1) naming the irradiance commit; ExifTool is RUN never READ.

### Constraints that apply

Full text in `./guidance/constraints.yaml`: `forbid-unsafe-code`, `panic-free-library` (no `#[allow]` below the crate root except the scoped test module), `no-io-in-library`, `no-new-top-level-deps-without-decision`.

### Prior related work

- SPEC-001 (merged, PR #3): the crate, lint block and ledger header you build on.
- Source to port FROM, READ ONLY, never modify: `~/PSeven/experiments/crustimg_redo_plus/irradiance/src/ifd.rs` (HEAD `2b6b07a`) and the `Error` enum in its `src/lib.rs`. The port map is `docs/porting-brief-diamond-exif.md` §1.1-§1.4 with line numbers.
- Host toolchain traps: see `guidance/toolchain-brief.md` (Homebrew cargo rejects `+toolchain`; Homebrew clippy shadows rustup's; `~/.cargo/bin/cargo +1.90.0` for the 1.90 check).

## Expected Deliverables

*(For a `verify` handoff, replace this block with the verify contract below.)*

- Code changes implementing SPEC-002's Acceptance Criteria.
- All failing tests in SPEC-002 now passing.
- Any new tests required to cover edge cases.
- Commits on your branch (no push, no PR); the architect opens the PR after verify.
- PR description referencing: this handoff ID, the spec ID, the stage
  ID, the project ID, all referenced `DEC-*`, and any new `DEC-*`
  created during implementation.

### If `cycle: verify` — the verify contract

You are **not** the agent that implemented this. Review it cold.

- Acceptance criteria met? Tests actually pass? Build reflection answered
  honestly (*"nothing was unclear"* is suspicious)?
- Decision drift — run `just decisions-audit --changed`.
- Constraint violations; non-trivial choices missing a `DEC-*`.
- For any criterion claiming **runtime behavior** (a component registers, a hook
  fires, a binary resolves on PATH, a config takes effect), confirm the
  *behavioral* surface was exercised — not just the shape validated. That is the
  defect class that escapes (AGENTS.md §12).
- Output exactly ONE of: ✅ APPROVED / ⚠ PUNCH LIST / ❌ REJECTED.

## Out of Scope

Explicit list of what this handoff does NOT include. If the receiving agent
thinks any of these need to happen, they should create a new spec in
the stage's backlog, not expand this handoff.

- Tolerant-walk policy, `ParseIssue`, pointer-tag walking, ASCII/signed/float decoders, oracle or fuzz work (SPEC-003..006).
- Any writer-facing API (encode twins, `Entry` constructors), `cost_the_field`, a new `is_structural` set.
- Editing irradiance, adding dependencies, publishing.

## Return Criteria — how to hand back

**Completing this handoff means filling in the `handback:` front-matter block
above AND the `## Handback` section below.** An unfilled handback is an
incomplete cycle, and `just handback-sync` will tell the orchestrator so.

On success:
1. Fill the `handback:` front-matter — **including a real `tokens_total`**.
2. Fill the `## Handback` section (the reflection is part of it, not optional).
3. Set `handoff.status` → `completed` and `handback.status` → `completed`.
4. Open a PR (build) or return your verdict (verify).

If you cannot complete the task:
1. Fill the `## Handback` section with what was done and what blocked you.
2. Set `handoff.status` → `rejected`, `handback.status` → `blocked`.
3. **Still report your token usage** — blocked work costs money too.
4. Set the spec's `task.blocked: true` and add a question to
   `/guidance/questions.yaml`.

## Handback

*Filled in by the receiving agent. The orchestrator does not reconstruct any of
this — it transcribes it. The reflection questions are part of completion.*

### Execution notes

- **Branch / PR:** [link]
- **Completed at:** YYYY-MM-DD
- **All acceptance criteria met?** yes/no (if no, explain)
- **For `verify`:** the verdict — ✅ APPROVED (at commit SHA) / ⚠ PUNCH LIST / ❌ REJECTED

### Cost self-report

Mirror what you put in the `handback:` front-matter, and say where the number
came from. **This is the number that lands in the spec** — the orchestrator
transcribes it via `just handback-sync`, it does not estimate it.

- **Tokens (total):** <real number, or null + why>
- **Estimated USD:** <number, or null>
- **Duration (minutes):** <estimate>
- **Source of the number:** `/cost` | API `usage` | harness report | none available

### Drift and new artifacts

- **New decisions emitted:**
  - `DEC-NNN` — <title> (if any)
- **Deviations from spec:**
  - [list]
- **Follow-up work identified:**
  - [any new specs that should be added to the stage's backlog]

### Reflection (3 questions, short answers)

1. **What was unclear in the spec or handoff that slowed you down?**
   — <answer>

2. **Was there a constraint or decision that should have been listed but wasn't?**
   — <answer>

3. **If you did this task again, what would you do differently?**
   — <answer>
